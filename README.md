# One Click Tiles

This is a plugin to complement Tileman Mode that will highlight tiles that can be reached in a single click without
unlocking new tiles.

Much of the code is based on that of the [Tileman Plugin](https://github.com/ConorLeckey/Tileman-Mode) and that of
Runemoro / Skretzo's [shortest path plugin](https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path).
